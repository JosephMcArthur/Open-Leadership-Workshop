#Â Open Knowledge Leaders Program Notes

These are my notes from the [Open Leadership Workshop](leaders.rufuspollock.org). I tried to do them via Github and a basic text editor for the first time. 

## While doing this I learned:

* How to turn local files into something Github understands. 
* I learned how to do basic things via Github locally
* I installed local commandline git tools
* That my text editor would make writing code easier, at least basic HTML. I'm wondering if there might be some plugins for other languages like CSS. 
* It's quite pleasing to write in markdown for a workshop. You don't need to leave the keyboard. 
* I need to work on my markdown skills
* I miss the on the fly formatting
* Landmark style in these types of training sessions seems really good
* This type of training is super useful.
