# Open Knowledge Leaders Program Notes

These are my notes from the [Open Leadership Workshop](leaders.rufuspollock.org). I tried to do them via Github and a basic text editor for the first time.

They're not intended as a polished synopsis of what I've taken from the weekend. They were written on the fly from what I was thinking and feeling at the time. I used writing them to clarify and process my thinking over the weekend. This is much more marked over day two where we were really challenged.

## What I learned about Github while doing this I learned:

* How to turn local files into something Github understands.
* I learned how to do basic things via Github locally
* I installed local command line git tools (but didn't use them)
* That my text editor would make writing code easier, at least basic HTML. I'm wondering if there might be some plugins for other languages like CSS.
* It's quite pleasing to write in markdown for a workshop. You don't need to leave the keyboard.
* I need to work on my markdown skills
* I miss the on the fly formatting
* Landmark style in these types of training sessions seems really good
* I prefer Atom to Sublime out the box.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Connect up Nationbuilder with my local system
- [x] Connect up OAB's repo's with my account and edit here - not on Github
- [ ] Edit a real HTML / CSS file here
- [x] Learn how to sync changes from online to my local files (may introduce a conflict).

Seeming it didn't, it just kind of worked.
