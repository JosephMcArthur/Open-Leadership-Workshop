# Open Knowledge Leaders Program

# Day one - Morning - Part 1

## Intros & Rules

* Rufus acknowledges us all for turning up! 
* His name is Rufus Pollock. Been a researcher / activist - now he says "social entrepreneur". Founded & run OK
* Grew up on a farm, mum doesn't know what he does, had 7 dogs & 3 cats. 
* Irina / Era: Only had one cat. Worked in the open space for about 6 years. Before that worked in print companies / banks. Led CKAN for years, which now powers 25 different nation states. Cares about decentralising tech (runs decentralise.org). 
* Mentions coach-ability (like landmark)
* Default to private
* Safe space
* Open minds "get what you can out of this"
* Be present (i.e. don't do this)
* Be on time bro. 

## What is open? 

* Often defined as vs. closed. 
* Public vs. Private is distinct from open vs. closed

### What's Public data? 
* E.g. Research data
* Definition: Information that could be legally and legitimately brought or sold to someone else e.g. music, movies, software

### What's Private data?
*  Personal information
*  The types of information Facebook has on us

Data & information insect at many different points. 

## Ideas people associate with Open is:

* Current
* Accessible
* Reliable
* Usable
* Shareable
* Findable
* Modifiable 
* Interoperable
* Reusable
* For any purpose
* For anytime
* Integrity
* Free
* Universal
* Unrestricted
* Level playing field
* Complete
* Dependable

Need to boil that down into what's actually key for open. ** Spoilers **: It's the reusable bit. 

## Context is important

* Ask for a coffee in a shop = expect to pay
* Ask for coffee in your house / work = don't expect to pay

When you talk about open outside of these circles there is no context. When you say "Open" it could just mean as in door. That's in contrast to issues like climate change. 

There is a lot of context needed to order a coffee. Your in a coffee shop, money exists, your both humans, you know what coffee is.  

What context MATTERS to communicate, "open"?

## Why is the digital age special?

* Processing power has doubled every 2 years
* The cost of sharing is nothing, if not small. 
* Copy with fidelity
* Information centralization
* Filtering problem on the amounts of information
* Information has become non-rivelrous.   
* There is now a gatekeeper to accessing info. To read paper you just need your eyes, to read it digitally you need word. That gives word control **cries**. 

Ironically the age which allows the greatest sharing has led to incredible centralization and inequality *bwam bwaaaaaam*

### Exercise

* When you say information, people often wont know what you mean. 
* For many people information = music / video / software / documents
* Give simple, relatable context. 

* Wikipedia is great context. People get that there used to be encyclopedias, now it's all-online. 
* Structure of a conversation: Here is a situation, here is a problem, and here is a call to action. 

Earlier in the structure we often apologies for the objections to the call to action. Better to be clear about what you're talking about at each point. Be clear and give simple messages.  

* It's important to practice explaining the context surrounding the information age. 

## The context that matters

1. We have more processing power
2. Data is different / information is different. Having a house doesn't mean there is a copy for everyone - having a copy of gangman style means there is. 

### My example

* What's special about humans is that we make stuff
* Over time we've got better and better at making stuff
* Agricultural revolution - we were able to make food better
* Industrial revolution - we were able to make tables better
* What's happening now: digital revolution
* What's different: You can share freely, and lose nothing
* However... 

Open is counter intuitive to many. We experience scarcity in everything we do. If you have cake, I don't, if you have jobs, I don't, if you have attention, I don't. This means an abundance of information is possible.

**Open is better than Cake.**

# Day 1 - Morning - Part 2

Simple information definition: everything that is or coupled be digitized.
Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify (or build upon) and share for any purpose.

## How do you connect openness to people? 

Yes, you can talk about having people know what the gov spends, but... what about more immediate stuff? 

* What's the best school locally? 
* Is this drug right for me? 
* What's the air quality round here? 

Often people aren't convinced by logical argument. What they're convinced by is your way of being, are you excited about something or clearly passionate about it? 

Often you're not passionate "open" per-se, but inequality, opportunity or just figuring out how to answer big questions more quickly.

I'm passionate about:

* Inequality
* Finding answers to problems faster & easier: like drugs. 

A generic structure for conversations about Open:

1. Situation/Context: I care about <<thing>> because <<reason>>
2. What's the problem / challenge / danger
3. How openness is an antidote to the above / what's the difference openness will make

An example structure for "my" conversation about open:

1. I care about curing diseases. I used to be a scientist.  
2. The problem is the way scientists share is stupid. 
3. Openness makes the difference because it allows scientists to work together better and cure these diseases faster

Examples for general structures that relate to everyone - the two m's - music & medicine. 

* The difference between the $20 it costs to make medicine and $60000 it cost to buy off the self is the cost of closed information. Open Science is about people not doing. 
* Music isn't life and death, but it's universal and relatable. The example of Spotify is really what openness looks like to many. There is abundance, music is discoverable, sharable and more. 

Finally, why open ever more generally:

* Inequality [insert slide text]
* Freedom [insert slide text]
* Power [insert slide text]
* Growth [insert slide text]
* Well-being [insert slide text]

# Day 1 - Afternoon - Part 1

## What is Leadership?

Enrolling someone by touch, moving and inspiring them. Instead getting them to do stuff "by force". By force doesn't mean physical, but by imposing authority or having them reluctantly agree. Getting people to do things "by force" often leads to the experience of "this person said they'd do something, but then they didn't". 

## What happens if we do nothing or what's the probable future

* Centralized proprietary world 
.* Back in the day, Western Union gave Intel on the democrats to the republicans and that swayed the elections. 

Fear sells. Stress what's wrong. Wrap that in a story and you're on to a winner.

For example, Google. For Rufus that means people get all their information about him there.

### Exercise

* Take 30 seconds to explain what happens if we do nothing - or what the big problems are
* You have to be really clear about the problem when you're trying to drive people to action.
* You need to be clear about what the problem is, and find a clear articulation of the issue. 
.* How do you feel about your election data in Germany coming from a for-profit corporation in San Francisco? Can you imagine anything going wrong with that? 
* Stories of these problems are best followed by stories of hope. Ultimately, Open offers hope.

## Barriers in the way of Open

### Music 

* Conservatism
* How will people be payd? 
* What would I get? Self-interest 
* Apathy from artists
* Open will make it worse. Google can just take all the music and make a service and new music. 
* Who has the power to make this work? 
* How will the economy work (will people lose jobs)
* How will it affect artist’s careers?
* Lack of autonomy or choice or artists
* Loss of power

But, to sum it up. Things normally come down too:

1. Who will pay for it? 
.* Business Models that rely on selling services around the content
..* Returns a private good
..* Two types of models
...1. Ketchup and fries. Have to give away the fries to sell the ketchup.
...2. Razor and Razor blades.

Sadly this doesn't really cut it for a fully Open world. However, it does give good jobs. Doctors / Engineers / Lawyers are actually ketchup and fries jobs in a way as they rely on a big pool of open information.  

.* Public Money
..* Returns a public good

This is the major mechanism we've funded public goods, and will continue to have to. Classic example is Research. However, even Linux, and therefor now Android, has roots in public funds. [Insert: Rufus's chain-link here.]

We could have open spotify for 90p a month. 

[Insert Graphic from Slide]

* The model takes the best of both socialism and capitalism.
* In this model you may still pay for servers, or you might still pay the rivelrous costs of a drug. But you don't pay for the idea or IP. 

# Day 1 - Afternoon - Part 2


2. How would we make it happen? 

* Change minds
.* Mistaken Mental Models: People think books are like bread. 
* Poor Power Dynamics
.* Lobbiest
.* When you have people on your side - 

* Make it ourselves

# This is what the Leaders Program is about
* Change minds
* ???
So, we need a project to practice. It can be either:
* Something you're already working on
* Something new
but it needs you to allow you to practice what your learning here. 

The project needs to: have a metric, inspire others, be fun, promote open. It needs to give you a chance practice your skills. 

My ideas:

* Community Strategy for OpenCon?
* OAB something, discussions with Authors about datasets and articles? Grant proposal. 
* Do an Open Leadership Workshop? 
* Open Slide deck and new deck for the community?
* Simply have my friends understand what I do, why I do it, and be excited about it (friends could = random people in coffee shop)
* ImpactStory idea

# Day 1 - Evening

[Integrity slides from Rufus]

* Need honouring your word slide on a code of conduct or something like that.
* HONOURING your word is different to keeping your word. 

[Restoring intergrity slide]

* Comment(s) from the crowd that this might be appropriate for all cultures. 
* What you put in place must be something outside yourself. "I'll try harder" has no real traction. 
* Important to say this outloud and include the impact on yourself. Humans often reflect by speaking. 
* With the first two points don't introduce "reasons". Keep them crisp. 

# Day 1 - Takeaways

* OpenCon: First name on badges should be big
* Watch this: Francis Erving "burning the digital paper"
* Learn about https://www.redhat.com/en business model

# MISC

* Daniel's Phone number: +41 794551705
* Lenses to look at open through:
.* Power
.* Scarcity / Abundance
* The size of tech (in the number of staff) companies getting to IPO's or 1 billion dollars is ever smaller
* Strategy vs. Tactics. For us, in this room, it's important to be clear on strategies. However what we often use to communicate is tactics. 
* Rufus doesn't think that group intros (20 seconds round the circle) isn't useful.
