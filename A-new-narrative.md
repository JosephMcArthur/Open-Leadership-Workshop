# An Open Information Age talk / workshop for R2RC

1. 3 great revolutions in making stuff
 * First food,
 * Then goods,
 * Now, information. [Chance to ask what information is / means]

2. What is different in an information age? [Chance to ask audience]
* Data is different.
 * It can be shared without loss of fidelity
 * It can be shared without cost to the owner
* Enough processing in our pocket to take on moonshots

3. A choice
 * If we do nothing
  * Those same traits allow untold concentration of powers
  * Ironically the age which allows the greatest sharing has led to incredible centralization and inequality
 * If we act, we get: [Chance to ask audience]
  * Inequality [insert slide text]
  * Freedom [insert slide text]
  * Power [insert slide text]
  * Growth [insert slide text]
  * Well-being [insert slide text]
